Collide proton at high energies to measure :
- Production rates
- Masses & lifetimes
- Decay rates

The above is used to derive the "spectroscopy" and "dynamics"
of elementary particles.

__More collision__ -> increased sensitivity to rare events <br>
__More energy__ -> probing higher masses, smaller distances & earlier times<br>


Spectroscopy :
- what particles do exists 
- what are their properties

Dynamics :
- what are forces 
- how do particles couple to the forces
- dependency on energy and angular momentum

__Jet__ :
spray of particles going in the same direction. Detect the particles, their direciton ( momenta)
and reconstruct the "jet" via some sort of "cone" algorthm that sums the momentum in that cone <br><br>

__Transverse energy scale__
